													<li><p>Refer to page 13 of the following document for more information about Computer and Internet Use: <a title="ACS Subject Definitions" href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2018_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf?" target="_blank">https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2018_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf?#</a></p></li>
													<li><p>Allocated data for computer and internet access are also available for download from ACS. Allocation is one method ACS uses to correct for item no response (i.e., to impute for missing data among households). It involves statistical procedures, such as within household or nearest neighbor matrices populated by donors, to impute missing values. More information on this approach is available: <a title="Sample size and data quality" href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/sample-size-and-data-quality/item-allocation-rates-definitions.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/sample-size-and-data-quality/item-allocation-rates-definitions.html</a>.</p></li>

				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><p>The American Community Survey (ACS) data are used to estimate characteristic distributions. It is also important to keep in mind that all ACS data are estimates. Data are collected from a sample of the population in the United States and Puerto Rico rather than from the whole population. To help interpret the reliability of the estimates, the Census Bureau publishes a margin of error (MOE) for every ACS estimate.  Guidance for Data Users of ACS can be found: <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html" target="_blank">https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html</a>.</p>

				<p><p>ACS data are based on survey responses. The computer and internet use questions were added to the ACS in 2013 and were mandated by the 2008 Broadband Improvement Act. The questions follow a "yes" or "no" format and respondents could select more than one category if applicable. These questions are not asked for the group quarters population, so do not include data about people living in housing such as dorms, prisons, nursing homes, etc. Guidance specific to these measures can be found here: <a title="Program Surveys for guidance specific to these measures" href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2018_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf?#" target="_blank">https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/tech_docs/subject_definitions/2018_ACSSubjectDefinitions.pdf?#</a>.

					Your queried dataset is available for download by clicking the export icon from within your query screen. The resulting .zip file will include your data in a .csv format as well as supporting information about the data.<br><br>
					The Tracking Network Data Application Program Interface (API) is an alternate way to query data from the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. The API provides a standardized URL interface with a JSON formatted result set that you can integrate into your applications. Below is a link to this query result (in JSON format) using our public API. <br>
